    body: 'I\'ve purchased this jacket two years in a row but opted for the large this time since the medium was a little snug but fit a medium in most everything Patagonia. Unfortunately, there is a massive size discrepancy between the large and medium. I\'m swimming in the large but constricted in the medium. Otherwise, a good casual jacket for moderately cold climates. Adjusting the pattern may be worthwhile.',
